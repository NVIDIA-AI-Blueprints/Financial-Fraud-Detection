# Graph NIMs

This repo will contains a collection of graph-based microservices that will be released as [NVIDIA NIMs](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/index.html). The repo is organized by folders, where each folder (excluding docs) is a NIM.

At as of now, this repo contains source code for only one NIM which focuses on training XGBoost models to predict fraud scores of credit card transactions.


## Training NIM
This NIM builds XGBoost model, using user provided configurations, to predict fraud scores of credit card transactions from embeddings generated by a GNN model. The NIM takes input data and produce a XGBoost model along with a GNN model that produces embeddings for credit card transactions. The NIM encapsulate the complexity of creating the graph in cuGraph and building key-value attribute store in WholeGraph. Once the graph is created, the GNN model is trained and used to produce the embeddings that are then feed to XGBoost.
